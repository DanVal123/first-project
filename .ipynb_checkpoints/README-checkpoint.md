# First-project
This is my first repository.  Maybe, I can just upload a jupyter notebook project here.

I just created a new branch, and I am still just on the GitHub website.  I'd like to learn how to use git locally as well on my computer with terminal.

Now, I am changing this file locally only, and I will try again to push this file to GitHub and hope that it will work.  Let's change it again a bit.

Let's do a few more changes, and see what I can do here.
